# Swift NBA Teams App

This iPhone application utilizes Core Data to store NBA team information and provides various features for managing and interacting with the teams. Let's explore the functionalities and structure of the app:

## Functionality

- CoreData Implementation: The app utilizes Core Data to store NBA team data, including attributes such as logo, name, abbreviation, stadium image, stadium name, city, division, conference, player image, draft, date of birth (dob), and height.

- Adding and Editing Teams: The app allows users to add new teams by providing information such as logo, name, abbreviation, stadium image, stadium name, city, division, conference, player image, draft, dob, and height. Users can also edit the parameters of existing teams.

- Deleting Teams: Users have the ability to delete existing teams from the app.

- Photo Selection: The app enables users to select photos for team logos, stadium images, and player images from their device's photo library.

- Favorite Teams: Users can mark teams as favorites using a switch, allowing them to easily access their preferred teams.

- Filtering Attempts: The app includes attempts to filter the table of teams using a favorites button and a search bar. However, these filtering features were reported as unsuccessful.

- Multi-Sized App Icons: The app provides multiple-sized app icon images that have been edited using GIMP, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing appearance across different device displays.
